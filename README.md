Welcome to the Esports Calendar (CS2)! This is a customizable tool for managing your Counter-Strike 2 tournaments locally in your browser. Each user has their own calendar, and you can export or import data to share or back up.

## Features

- **Custom Colors**: Choose between Blue, Orange, Green, Red, Purple, and Yellow for your tournaments.
- **Tournament Management**: Add, edit, and delete tournaments with details such as name, tier, dates, teams, location, and mode.
- **Sorting**: Sort tournaments by date or whether they count toward RSV.
- **Export/Import**: Save your data to a JSON file or load previous backups.
- **Integrated Help**: Access instructions from the interface.

## Instructions for Use
1. **Download the file**: Click on [esports_calendar.html](esports_calendar.html) and save it to your computer.
2. **Open in your browser**: Double-click the file or open it with any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
3. **Add tournaments**: Fill out the form and click "Add Tournament".
4. **Edit or delete**: Use the "Edit" or "Delete" buttons on the table or calendar.

## Requirements
- Internet connection to load Tailwind CSS and FullCalendar resources (CDNs).

## Important Notes
- **Local Data**: Tournaments are saved in your browser using `localStorage`. They are not automatically shared with others.
- **Privacy**: If you export your calendar (JSON), do not share it if it contains sensitive information (e.g., personal data).
- **Backups**: We recommend exporting regularly to avoid losing your data.
